## Introduction

Mathematical algorithms play a crucial role in various fields, from number theory and cryptography to data analysis and optimization. This README provides an overview of several mathematical algorithms, each with its own unique applications and significance.

## 1. Euclidean Algorithm

- **Description**: The Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It repeatedly applies the formula: `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)` until `b` becomes 0.

## 2. Sieve of Eratosthenes

- **Description**: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It eliminates multiples of each prime, iteratively marking non-prime numbers.

## 3. Fibonacci Sequence

- **Description**: The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It has applications in mathematics, computer science, and nature.

## 4. Prime Factorization

- **Description**: Prime Factorization decomposes a composite number into its prime factors. It is a fundamental concept in number theory and has applications in cryptography.

## 5. Fast Exponentiation

- **Description**: Fast Exponentiation is an algorithm to efficiently calculate the power of a number. It reduces the number of multiplications required by exploiting the properties of exponents.

## 6. LCM (Least Common Multiple)

- **Description**: The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. It is related to the GCD through the formula: `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`.

## 7. Slope of a Line

- **Description**: The Slope of a Line is a measure of its steepness. It is calculated as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change between two points on the line.

## 8. Lucas Series

- **Description**: The Lucas Series is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci Sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. It starts with 2 and 1.

## 9. Krishnamurthy number

- **Description**: A Krishnamurthy number is a number whose sum of the factorial of digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 145 is the sum of the factorial of each

## 10. Pascal's Triangle

-**Description**: Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It has applications in probability theory, algebra, and combinatorics.
