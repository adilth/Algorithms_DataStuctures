# Binary Tree

Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operations are as fast as in a linked list.

## Important Terms

The following are the important terms concerning trees.

- Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

- Root − The node at the top of the tree is called the root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

- **Parent** − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called a parent.

- **Child** − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

- **Leaf** − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

- **Subtree** − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

- **Visiting** − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

- **Traversing** − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

- **Levels** - Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

- **keys** - the Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.

## BST Basic Operations

The basic operations that can be performed on a binary search tree data structure are the following −

- **Insert** − Insert an element in a tree/create a tree.

- **Search** − Searches an element in a tree.

- **Preorder** Traversal − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

- **Inorder** Traversal − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

- **Postorder** Traversal − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
